# Python Tutorial Demos

Welcome to this repository! 👋 <br>
This collection contains the Python demo scripts I presented during my tutorial sessions for first-year students in the PCL1 and PCL2 course.
The goal of these demos is to explain core programming concepts in a simple, hands-on way and help beginners gain confidence in writing and understanding Python code.

## 🧑‍🏫 About These Demos

These scripts were created to support my tutorials and are meant as learning resources, not production-ready code.
They are written with readability and clarity in mind, often including comments and explanatory print statements.

The goal is to show:
- How to translate theoretical concepts into code
- Step-by-step problem solving in Python
- Common beginner pitfalls and how to avoid them

## 📚 Who Is This For?
- 🧑‍🎓 First-year students learning Python
- 👩‍💻 Anyone looking for beginner-friendly code examples
- 📚 Teaching assistants or instructors searching for classroom demos
