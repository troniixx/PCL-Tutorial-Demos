1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,980
So, in this
video we're gonna talk about

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,120
where we all have artificial
intelligence, or AI,

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,980
in our lives.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,040
And so, before I go into
where we're already seeing it

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,280
and where we're likely to
start seeing it more and more,

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,170
I want you to pause this video

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,450
and think if you can think of any places

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,890
where artificial intelligence

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,473
is already impacting your life.

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,730
All right, now let's
think about this together.

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,520
So, I'm guessing that many of you

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,110
have interacted with a
smartphone of some kind

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,240
and you might've said, "Hey, Siri,"

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,220
and/or just pressed
this button long enough

15
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,330
and it says, "Well, what do you like?"

16
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,680
And you talk to it.

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,830
Well, that is artificial intelligence, AI.

18
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,660
And once again, why is that AI?

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,950
Well, it seems intelligent,

20
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,320
it can understand what
you're asking it to do,

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,700
it can find you information,

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,790
it can do some tasks for you.

23
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,030
So, it seems intelligent and
it was definitely not natural,

24
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,210
it's technology, it was
made by human beings

25
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,850
so it is artificial intelligence.

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,580
I'm guessing many of you
might also have interacted

27
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,530
with devices in your house.

28
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,450
You might have once
again said, "Hey, Siri,"

29
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,000
or "Hey, Alexa," or "Google Home,"

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,590
or some other type of device

31
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,880
and it starts talking to you

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,560
and you say, "What's the
weather going to be today?"

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,170
Or, "How far is the sun away from Earth?"

34
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,630
And so, once again, it seems intelligent,

35
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,320
it's able to understand
what you're saying,

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,730
it even knows when you're calling on it,

37
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,590
it's kind of creepy that
it's always listening,

38
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,590
and then it's able to do tasks for you.

39
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,590
You might see AI when
you make a web search.

40
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,870
So, if you go to some search engine

41
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,110
and you do a search

42
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,080
for, let's say, shoes,

43
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,790
oftentimes you're going to see a bunch

44
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,410
of ads show up first

45
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,330
and then you're going to see
a bunch of search results.

46
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,940
These results are usually

47
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,880
not just the same results for everyone,

48
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,360
they're based on what some
artificial intelligence

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,530
on the search engine side

50
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,170
thinks that you are
most likely to click on.

51
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,550
Now, in the future,

52
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,289
in future videos we'll talk about

53
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,930
how does it know what people
are most likely to click on?

54
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,120
How does it optimize around that?

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,860
But you have artificial intelligence

56
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,250
trying to figure out
what to serve up to you.

57
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,760
You might look at some
type of social media app,

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,030
which I don't recommend
spending too much time on it,

59
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,570
but it's giving you a
feed of, say, videos,

60
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,890
say, on an app like TikTok,

61
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,480
which, once again, I don't recommend

62
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,980
spending a ton of time on it

63
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,350
because there's literally
an artificial intelligence

64
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,070
in the background that's
trying to feed you the thing

65
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,220
that you are most likely to engage on.

66
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,920
And you might say, "Well,
what's the big deal about that?

67
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,230
I might just get entertained
or whatever else."

68
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,780
But you might also just
get addicted to it,

69
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,550
it just keeps feeding you the things

70
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,500
that it's seeing that
other people like you

71
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,140
are likely to keep wanting to watch.

72
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,720
And it not only might
take up a lot of time

73
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,290
that you could do spending
outside being with real people,

74
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,640
but it's also feeding you ads,

75
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,700
making you want things that
you don't necessarily need.

76
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,230
It could be showing you things

77
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,700
that are affecting your opinions

78
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,010
in maybe the not most constructive way,

79
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,780
maybe ways it's putting you,

80
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,610
it's reinforcing opinions
you already have,

81
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,010
making it harder for you to
see the other points of view.

82
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,420
And so, we have to be very careful,

83
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,980
but that's definitely a place

84
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,040
where we are seeing
artificial intelligence.

85
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,630
We also see it, you might
think about self-driving cars.

86
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,560
If you think about a car, most of us view,

87
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,910
you have to be pretty intelligent

88
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,940
to recognize things on the road,

89
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,060
be able to read street
signs, et cetera, et cetera.

90
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,730
But these cars have a
bunch of sensors on them,

91
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,890
depending on the type of self-driving car

92
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,940
you're thinking about,

93
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,890
where it's able to make
sense of the images

94
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,410
and other types of sensory
input it has around it

95
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,780
and do things that until recently

96
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,600
people would've thought only
a human could drive a car,

97
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,060
but now we actually have technology

98
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,520
that can make sense of it.

99
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,750
Now, these are all places

100
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,300
where we're seeing artificial intelligence

101
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,850
already affecting our lives.

102
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,050
Where is it likely to affect
our lives more and more?

103
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,730
Well, there are applications

104
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,230
that people have already come up with

105
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,990
where maybe you could take a picture

106
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,079
of maybe you have a rash on your skin

107
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,050
and it could maybe help diagnose,

108
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,760
maybe be an assistant to a doctor

109
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,160
or maybe in places where there
aren't doctors help there,

110
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,570
maybe read an x-ray

111
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,050
or any other type of imagery
to understand what's going on.

112
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,270
It could be used to create.

113
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,090
Many of you have seen videos

114
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,280
where that have been created by AI,

115
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,380
you've seen images that
have been created by AI.

116
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,880
So, it's more and more
going to be a creation tool.

117
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,870
You're going to see cases,

118
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,480
and this is obviously something
that we, at Khan Academy,

119
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,060
take very seriously where
it could help you learn.

120
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,020
Tools like Khanmigo, where
which we have at Khan Academy,

121
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,790
where it can act as a tutor.

122
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,330
Not give you the answer, so
I'll just write tutoring here.

123
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,330
Tutoring, it could not
give you the answer,

124
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,580
but help you think about how to get there.

125
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,730
It could be a writing coach.

126
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,110
I guess that's a kind of
tutoring, writing coach.

127
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,210
It could be a teacher's assistant.

128
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll just write TA, TA for short,

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,190
where it could help a
teacher develop lesson plans,

130
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,310
or grade papers, or
write progress reports.

131
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,240
So, I'll leave you there.

132
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,040
This is just scratching the surface

133
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,560
of where you, one, already
have artificial intelligence

134
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,600
in your life but just
might not realize it,

135
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,090
but it's good you do realize
it 'cause it's out there.

136
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,110
Some of it's useful,

137
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,150
but you have to be
careful with a lot of it,

138
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,630
and it's going to affect your
lives more and more and more

139
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,893
in the years to come.
