1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,370
In this
video, we're gonna see

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,680
that you could have very
different experiences

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,360
with the same AI,

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,470
and a lot of that is depending
on how we prompt the AI.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,560
So before we even start doing
some prompting ourselves

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,300
or even understanding what that means,

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,040
let's just play around a little bit.

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,520
So I'm here on my account on ChatGPT,

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,200
and I'm using GPT-4 as my
model, the underlying model.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,540
Remember ChatGPT is the application.

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,800
It can use different models.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,009
I could use GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,900
In this case, these are from open AI.

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,230
And let's say that I
want help understanding

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,410
some concept in science.

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,410
So let's say I want to understand how,

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,283
let's say how photosynthesis works.

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,910
How photosynthesis works?

19
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,140
Exclamation mark.

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,440
I really wanna understand.

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,160
So over here, ChatGPT using GPT 4,

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,410
it's essentially creating
a a bit of an article.

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,020
This is very similar to what I would see

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,000
if I were to go to Wikipedia,

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,350
or if I were to just do a web search.

26
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,154
It's actually giving
a very lengthy article

27
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:15,271
whether or not I'm in
the mood of reading this,

28
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:16,680
but says this is a fascinating process.

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,420
It allows plants and
algae and some bacteria.

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,160
It talks about the absorption of light.

31
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,990
This is a pretty involved article,

32
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,580
but once again, not that different than

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,310
what I would find if I went
to Wikipedia or the internet.

34
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,130
Now as a comparison, let's go to Khanmigo,

35
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,240
and do the same thing.

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,720
And I'm using the Tutor Me
in math and science activity.

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,060
And Kahnmigo, this version of Khanmigo,

38
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,940
is still using the same underlying model.

39
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,580
It is using GPT 4 at least at the time

40
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,560
of me making this video.

41
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,540
But let me ask the same question.

42
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,540
I want to understand how
photosynthesis works?

43
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,250
I'll do the exclamation mark as well.

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,690
And it says, ah, photosynthesis,
the magic trick plants

45
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,160
use to turn sunlight into food.

46
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,300
Let's dive in.

47
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,710
First, can you tell me

48
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,590
what you already know
about photosynthesis?

49
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,423
So know what you're thinking.

50
00:02:08,423 --> 00:02:12,120
Wait, Sal, this is the
exact same underlying model,

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,030
but it's doing something
very different here.

52
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,490
Here it's really acting like a tutor.

53
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,160
And instead of just giving
me a big verbal dump

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,490
of an article, it is actually
asking me a question.

55
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,287
Well, I could keep going into it.

56
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:30,287
Oh, I know that is how plants

57
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,283
convert sunlight into food.

58
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,300
Great start, now let's dig a bit deeper.

59
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,950
Photosynthesis involves two main stages.

60
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,510
Can you name them?

61
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,680
Interesting.

62
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,600
So it's really trying to quiz me,

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,920
making sure that I'm understanding this.

64
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,170
So the question, and I could
obviously spend hours talking

65
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,330
about photosynthesis with Kahnmigo,

66
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,440
but that's not the point of this video.

67
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,410
The point of this video is
why is Kahnmigo behaving

68
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,400
so differently than that
interaction we saw with ChatGPT,

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,640
even though it's using
the same underlying model?

70
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,460
And the answer is, it's prompting.

71
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,290
There's other things
that work with Kahnmigo,

72
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,490
but for the most part,

73
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,160
the Khan Academy team have created prompts

74
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,380
that encourage, or direct,

75
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,030
or steer is actually the right word,

76
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,930
people calling steering a model,
to act as a socratic tutor.

77
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,500
Not to give big verbal dumps like you saw,

78
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,810
but to ask questions, make sure
the students' understanding,

79
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,300
and then dig a little bit deeper.

80
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,840
Now you might wonder what does
a prompt like that look like?

81
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,940
Well, I could do that here on ChatGPT,

82
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,680
although it takes a
little bit of more work.

83
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,173
I could say something like,
you are a socratic tutor.

84
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,123
I am your student.

85
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,910
Try.

86
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,790
Well, let's just start with
that as a simple prompt.

87
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,183
I will ask you questions.

88
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,400
And I'm gonna copy and paste this.

89
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,080
There's more efficient ways of doing this.

90
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,940
But just so that you,
I'll copy it for now,

91
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,230
so we can use it later.

92
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,213
And let's see what it does.

93
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,580
I'm ready to help you explore

94
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,840
and understand any questions you have.

95
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,710
What's on your mind today?

96
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,710
So it's already doing
something very different than

97
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,050
what we saw in that previous
example when I just asked

98
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,640
how photosynthesis works.

99
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,231
So I'm gonna say, I want to know how

100
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:25,440
photosynthesis works?

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,550
Exclamation mark.

102
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,230
Alright, great topic.

103
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,610
Let's start by exploring the basics

104
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,440
of photosynthesis together.

105
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,040
So it's still not doing what Khanmigo did.

106
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,023
It's still, you know,

107
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,910
giving me maybe a little
bit more verbiage,

108
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,550
or more text than I might like.

109
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,780
So let's start over here.

110
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,720
Let's start another thread.

111
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,030
And this time I copy and past it.

112
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,900
Your Socratic tutor.

113
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,830
I am your student, I
will ask you questions.

114
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,830
Keep your responses as short as possible

115
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:05,725
Well, let's just do that for now.

116
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,120
So that was essentially my prompt.

117
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,430
Understood, please go
ahead with your question.

118
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,273
How does photosynthesis works?

119
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,603
Let's see how it's responding now.

120
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,030
So photosynthesis converts light energy

121
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,863
into chemical energy.

122
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,130
Plants use sunlight.

123
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,710
So it is doing what I asked it to do.

124
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,150
It's giving a shorter response.

125
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:27,983
Would you like more detail?

126
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:30,360
But it's still just kinda
giving me the answer.

127
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,160
So I want it to be more Socratic.

128
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,570
So let's do this.

129
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,640
You are a Socratic
tutor, I'm your student.

130
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,640
I will ask you questions,
keep your responses

131
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,100
as short as possible,

132
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,760
and try to ask me

133
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,990
questions on my understanding,

134
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,183
rather understanding,

135
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,463
rather than just giving me answers.

136
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,444
Let's see what it does now.

137
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:08,510
So how does photosynthesis work?

138
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,060
Photosynthesis is the process plants use

139
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,893
to make their own food.

140
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:18,870
Can you tell me where it primarily
takes place in the plant?

141
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,420
So you can see it's getting
closer to what we just saw

142
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,500
with Kahnmigo by giving it that prompt,

143
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,020
and that prompt that we
saw at the beginning.

144
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,300
Every time it goes back
and forth with the AI,

145
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,520
the AI sees this at the beginning

146
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,140
of our conversation stream,

147
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,310
and that essentially primes
the AI to behave in that way.

148
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,950
And you could do prompts to
do some pretty fun things.

149
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,010
So let's say you, actually let me just.

150
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,150
I should have copied and paste it.

151
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,830
Actually, I think I can.

152
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,010
I can go back here.

153
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,200
Let me copy and paste what I just had,

154
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,833
and I'll create a new
thread, a new conversation.

155
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,330
Speak in the tone

156
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,003
of Dr. Seuss.

157
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,590
Let's see what happens.

158
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,720
Oh, a question you have
my dear friend, indeed,

159
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,000
a curious mind is a wonderful seed.

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,980
Now ask away, don't delay, let's proceed.

161
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,080
What's on your mind, what
knowledge do you need?

162
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,640
I kinda like this one.

163
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,413
How does photosynthesis work?

164
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,250
In a leafy green world

165
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,920
where the sunlights a treat,
plants take the light.

166
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,480
Oh, so bright and so neat.

167
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,410
But how do they do it?

168
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,970
You ask, isn't that sweet?

169
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,290
Can you guess what they need

170
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,840
besides light from the
sun to make sugar and food

171
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,910
and have all of their fun?

172
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,110
So there you go.

173
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,590
That's prompting by giving
it clear instructions

174
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,720
of what you want,
especially when you begin.

175
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,900
And later we'll talk about
how you can save this

176
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,650
so you don't have to
write this every time,

177
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,410
or there's ways to do it
depending on what app you need.

178
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,880
But this is how you can steer
an AI, a large language model,

179
