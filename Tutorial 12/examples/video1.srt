1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,820
In this video,
we're going to talk about

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,750
what artificial intelligence even is.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,960
So to start with that, let's
just break down these words,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,700
artificial and intelligence.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,500
And we could start with intelligence.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,213
What does that mean to you?

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,040
Well, for most of us,

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,510
we associate intelligence
with things that our brains,

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,770
that our minds, are doing.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,800
Things like solving problems,

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,100
solving problems,

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,263
maybe logic,

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,320
maybe playing games,

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,743
especially games that involve the mind,

15
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:42,690
games like chess or checkers,

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,520
playing games, making recommendations,

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,940
making recommendations.

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,153
We could also imagine
things like creativity,

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,160
creativity,

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,260
making things that have
never existed before,

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,190
whether it's a painting

22
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,620
or whether it is a story of some kind.

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,880
And I could keep going,

24
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,410
and you could come up with your own list

25
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,230
of what do you associate
with intelligence,

26
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,980
what do you think makes
you or me intelligent?

27
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,000
Now let's think about this
other word here, artificial.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,210
Artificial, and it
comes from the same root

29
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,190
as art or artifact.

30
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,560
It's really something that has been made.

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,560
So something made,

32
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,560
something made by humans,

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,970
usually by us.

34
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,550
I guess if an alien
civilization made something,

35
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,040
that would also be considered artificial.

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,060
You could also view it

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,600
as something that would
not exist naturally.

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,827
So it doesn't exist naturally,

39
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,053
so, or exist in nature.

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,430
So for example, my intelligence,

41
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,020
if you think I'm intelligent,

42
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,610
is natural intelligence.

43
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,810
It exists in nature,

44
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,130
it comes out of a
biological system, my brain,

45
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,050
while what we're gonna
talk about in a little bit

46
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,180
are things, forms of intelligence

47
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,490
or things that might be
called an intelligence,

48
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,670
that we made, that
doesn't exist in nature.

49
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,910
Now, a lot of y'all have
seen science fiction movies

50
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,270
where there is some type of a robot,

51
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,770
and this is my very quick drawing

52
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,410
of a robot right over here,

53
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,290
that can talk and walk

54
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,850
and do a lot of the things

55
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,880
that we would consider intelligent.

56
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,180
And if robots like that ever exist,

57
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,670
and really every day we're
getting closer and closer,

58
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,110
but if they ever existed,

59
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,270
these are science fiction's images

60
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,430
of what an artificial
intelligence would be.

61
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,920
And it doesn't need to have a body.

62
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,720
You could have something
that you just talk to.

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,360
There's science fiction
movies where the spaceship,

64
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,790
you can talk to it and you
have a conversation with it.

65
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,590
And it seems intelligent,

66
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,210
but it was created by man,

67
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,860
it is artificial.

68
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,473
It did not exist in nature by itself.
