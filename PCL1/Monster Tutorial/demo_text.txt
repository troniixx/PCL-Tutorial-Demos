The ancient oak stood at the edge of the forest, its branches reaching toward the darkening sky. The locals called it the Whispering Tree, for the peculiar way the wind rustled through the leaves. The children of the village would gather beneath the sprawling canopy, listening to the stories that seemed to float down from the rustling branches. 
On the morning of the summer solstice, the baker's daughter discovered something extraordinary near the base of the tree. The ground had shifted during the night, revealing the entrance to an underground chamber. The girl rushed to tell the village elder, who had spent decades studying the legends of the ancient oak. The elder gathered the townspeople, and together they descended into the mysterious cavity beneath the tree.
